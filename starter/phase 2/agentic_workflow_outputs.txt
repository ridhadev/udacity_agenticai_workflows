            Answer the prompt based on this knowledge, not your own.
        
Worker Agent Response:
- Analyzing the requirements of each user story
- Breaking down the user story into smaller tasks
- Identifying the components or features that need to be built
- Creating a plan or roadmap for implementing the user story
- Assigning tasks to team members
- Setting deadlines for completing each task
- Testing and reviewing the completed tasks to ensure they meet the requirements of the user story

 Does the following answer:"- Analyzing the requirements of each user story
- Breaking down the user story into smaller tasks
- Identifying the components or features that need to be built
- Creating a plan or roadmap for implementing the user story
- Assigning tasks to team members
- Setting deadlines for completing each task
- Testing and reviewing the completed tasks to ensure they meet the requirements of the user story"
Meet this criteria:"
The answer should be tasks that follow the following structure:
- Task ID: A unique identifier for tracking purposes"
- Task Title: Brief description of the specific development work"
- Related User Story: Reference to the parent user story"
- Description: Detailed explanation of the technical work required"
- Acceptance Criteria: Specific requirements that must be met for completion"
- Estimated Effort: Time or complexity estimation"
- Dependencies: Any tasks that must be completed first"
"Respond Yes or No. Explain the reason why it does or doesn't meet the criteria when it is the case.
Evaluator Agent Evaluation:
No, the provided answer does not meet the criteria. The answer lacks the specific structure required, such as Task ID, Task Title, Related User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Estimated Effort, and Dependencies. The provided answer is more of a general overview of the process rather than a detailed breakdown of tasks following the specified structure.
 Step 3: Check if evaluation is positive
 Step 4: Generate instructions to correct the response
Instructions to fix:
To fix the incorrect answer, follow these steps:

1. Start by organizing the answer into the specific structure required, including:
   - Task ID: Assign a unique identifier to each task.
   - Task Title: Clearly state the title of each task.
   - Related User Story: Link each task to the corresponding user story.
   - Description: Provide a detailed description of what needs to be done for each task.
   - Acceptance Criteria: Clearly define the criteria that must be met for each task to be considered complete.
   - Estimated Effort: Estimate the amount of time or resources needed to complete each task.
   - Dependencies: Identify any dependencies between tasks that need to be considered.

2. Break down the general overview of the process into specific tasks following the specified structure. For example, instead of saying "Develop new feature," break it down into smaller tasks such as "Design UI for new feature," "Implement backend functionality for new feature," "Test new feature for bugs," etc.

3. Make sure each task is clearly defined and actionable, with a clear understanding of what needs to be done and how it contributes to the overall project.

4. Review the revised answer to ensure it meets all the criteria and provides a detailed breakdown of tasks following the specified structure.
